      General Description
</h2></center>
      <ul>
       <li><span>Data collection and analysis:</span> The dashboard will gather information from a range of trustworthy sources, such as public records, academic institutions, and satellite photography. In order to examine trends and patterns in agriculture, crop production, climate, and other pertinent elements, it will make use of data analytics and visualization approaches</li>
         <br><br> <li>
            <span> Obstacles and Opportunities:</span> The dashboard will highlight the major obstacles that the agricultural industry faces, such a lack of water, a changing climate, market access, and small landholding sizes. The prospects for sustainable practices, crop diversification, and value addition will also be highlighted.
          </li>
         <br><br> <li>
           <span>Visualizing Geospatial Data:</span>  Agricultural productivity, land use, and irrigation patterns across various areas will be shown graphically using geospatial mapping. This will make it possible for stakeholders and policymakers to pinpoint regions in need of focused actions.
          </li>
          <br><br><li>
            The dashboard will highlight successful case studies of farmers and communities that have adopted sustainable agricultural techniques. It will include details on agroforestry, organic farming, water-efficient irrigation, and other ecologically beneficial approaches.
          </li>
          <br><br>  <li>
           <span>
            Forecasting and Early Warning System: 
           </span> The dashboard will provide a forecasting and early warning system for extreme occurrences like droughts and floods by combining weather and climate data. This will help farmers plan ahead and make well-informed decisions.
          </li>
          <br><br>  <li>
           <span>
            Market Linkages and Price Trends:
           </span>  Information on market access and price developments for agricultural commodities will be shown on the dashboard. Farmers will benefit from its assistance in locating viable markets, lowering their reliance on intermediaries, and assuring fair pricing.
          </li>

          <li><i>Among various definitions, we selected agroecology as a lens of investigation in our study, as
            it adequately captures all the three dimensions of sustainability—economic, environmental,
            and social. Broadly, it refers to less resource-intensive farming solutions, provides more
            diversity in crops and livestock, and allows farmers to adapt to local circumstances </i></li><br><br>
            <center><h2 style="color: green;">
              State of sustainable agriculture in India</h2></center>
        <li><i>In all, we identified 30 sustainable agriculture practices (SAPs) prevalent in India. Some are
          focused only on one aspect of agriculture (we call them practices). In contrast, others are
          more holistic concerning the overall agriculture or most aspects of it (we call them systems).
          We collectively refer to them as sustainable agriculture practices and systems (SAPSs). Many
          practices have overlaps among themselves, and some individual practices are also advocated
          under a few systems </i></li>

            Impact literature on India’s sustainable agriculture</h2></center>
      <li><i>From the systematic review of literature, we find that agroforestry, CA, and SRI are the most
        popular among researchers assessing the impact of SAPSs on various outcomes . In contrast, the impact evidence around permaculture and floating farming in the
        Indian context is almost non-existent. The impact evidence of biodynamic agriculture is
        also very limited currently. Regarding different areas of outcomes, most of the SAPSs have
        many publications focusing on environmental indicators followed by economic and social
        ones. However, organic farming, natural farming, and integrated farming systems have many
        publications focused on economic outcomes</i></li>
